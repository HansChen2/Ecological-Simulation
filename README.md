# Ecological-Simulation

A Model of Grain Growth and Animal Interaction

## Overview

The primary of this project is to simulate an ecosystem, focusing on the growth of grain and the deer population over six years. It considers environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation to demonstrate their influence on ecosystem dynamics. Additionally, it uses OpenMP for parallel execution, enhancing the efficiency of the simulation.

## Mission Statement

This is one of the projects of CS575 of Oregon State University in the 2021 spring term. This project mainly uses parallelism to simulate the ecosystem.


## Result

As we can observe in the graph, the precipitation level directly impacts grain height. There is a positive correlation between high precipitation and increased grain height, and vice versa. Furthermore, when grain height is high, the deer population also increases.
